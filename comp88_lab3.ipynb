These models have losses that are not smooth and aren't suited to simple gradient-based optimisation. You are only asked to produce naïve, brute force implementations of these models, but do note that such implementations can scale really badly, so be cautious about running the algorithms with large sample sizes. You may find it interesting to think about what strategies could be used to speed things up.\n",
