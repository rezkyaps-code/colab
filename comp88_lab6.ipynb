Instead you will typically use components provided by a **deep learning framework**. In this week's exercises you will do just that, building several different neural network models using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). These models will also be tested on somewhat more complex data than in previous weeks, doing **image classification** on several standard datasets.\n",

        "Recurrent neural networks impose a sequential structure on the data, carrying a memory of earlier processing steps forward through the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "PyTorch includes three standard recurrent layers that you can include in your models: a vanilla recurrent unit ([nn.RNN](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.RNN.html)), a **long short-term memory** unit ([nn.LSTM](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LSTM.html)) and a **gated recurrent unit** ([nn.GRU](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.GRU.html)). All three have very similar interfaces and can be used interchangeably here. You should choose which kind to create according to the `unit_type` argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "Image data can be considered as a kind of sequence, eg as a sequence of pixels or a sequence of rows. (Other schemes are also possible if you feel like experimenting.) But the original image data is not in that format, so you will need to **reshape** it in order to match the expected structure, converting each 3D image shape (channels $\\times$ height $\\times$ width) into a 2D sequence one (steps $\\times$ features). If you treat single pixels as tokens, then the sequence length will be the number of pixels in the image; if you treat rows as tokens, then the sequence will be the number of rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll need to specify the input size (ie, the size of a single sequence token) when you create the recurrent unit, basing it on the supplied `input` argument and your reshaping strategy. You'll then need to do the actual reshaping in your `forward` method, before sending the data to the RNN. (As a result, in this case you can't just fall back on the superclass implementation.) You may also find it helpful to specify `batch_first=True` when creating the unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "As with the CNN, you'll also need to pass the RNN outputs through a fully connected layer to generate the `output` class logits. Again, there will be some reshaping required here, so in this case it makes sense to have two separate model chunks, rather than trying to pack everything into a Sequential model.\n"
